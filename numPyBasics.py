# Program that takes user input to create an array of any dimensions,
# and return the indexes of integers that are divisible by 2.
# The arrays created are also stored in a cache, allowing the user to view previously created arrays
###

###
# Things I want to modify:
#   - Finish 'menu', allowing the user to move freely between creating and viewing
#   - Clean up code; create functions for easily reusable code
#   - Find faster solutions to some of the numerous 'if' statements
